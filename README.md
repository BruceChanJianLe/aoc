# 🎄 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

> Advent of Code is an annual coding event that releases a new two-part
> programming puzzle every day from December 1st through the 25th, not always.
> Wrapped in a whimsical holiday-themed story, these puzzles range from simple
> logic tasks to complex algorithmic challenges, encouraging participants to
> solve them in any language they choose. It has become a global tradition for
> developers to test their problem-solving skills, learn new languages, or just
> an event nerdy friends can hang out together!
